## 🧑‍💻 Developer Note

This project was created during the first 1-2 months of my C# learning journey as a personal practice project.  
The goal was to reinforce fundamental programming concepts and support my learning process.

Although I have since developed more advanced and comprehensive projects, I decided to include this repository on my GitHub profile because it represents an important part of my learning journey and demonstrates my foundational knowledge.

💫 I also believe it can serve as a helpful guide for beginner developers.
